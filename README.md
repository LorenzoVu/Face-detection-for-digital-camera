# Face Detection System for Digital Cameras

## Introduction
This notebook implements a robust and lightweight face detection system designed specifically for embedded digital camera applications. The system is engineered to operate efficiently on resource-constrained hardware (Cortex-A55â€“class SoC) while maintaining real-time performance and high accuracy for face detection tasks.

## Project Overview
Our face detection system employs a two-stage cascade approach to efficiently identify faces in images:

1. **Stage 1 - Fast Rejector**: Uses Local Binary Patterns (LBP) with a Random Forest classifier to quickly eliminate most non-face regions with minimal computational cost
2. **Stage 2 - Precise Verifier**: Applies Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) with a Linear SVM to accurately verify face candidates that passed the first stage

### Implementation Pipeline
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Processes training, validation, and test image sets with face annotations
2. **Feature Extraction**: Implements LBP and HOG feature extraction for facial pattern recognition
3. **Model Training**: Trains and optimizes Random Forest and SVM classifiers with hyperparameter tuning
4. **Face Detection**: Applies the trained models using a sliding window approach with scale pyramid
5. **Post-Processing**: Implements non-maximum suppression to eliminate redundant detections
6. **Performance Evaluation**: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and computational efficiency

This notebook serves as a comprehensive implementation of the complete face detection pipeline, from data preparation to final model evaluation.
